                    I am a hard working individual that loves learning. I am an enthusiast and a dedicated scholar in the field of software engineeering.I am the type of person to work alone on projects but I appreciate having a team and helping each other on projects. I really enjoy solving problems and finding specific solutions to those problems through research and strategic planning. Big sports fan and I jog from time to time.I would say my biggest life lesson so far is that life comes with its ups and downs but whats important is how we deal with those moments
